# Welcome to my Portfolio

This repository serves as an overview of my personal portfolio.  
Here you will find a collection of projects that highlight my skills in software development, data analysis, and applied machine learning.  
I work with libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib** to build models, process data, and extract insights.  
The goal of these projects is to demonstrate not only technical knowledge, but also the ability to deliver clear, reproducible, and practical solutions.  

## Projects
- **Beta-Convergence Analysis** – A data science project examining global economic trends through linear regression modeling. Comparing developed vs. developing countries across multiple time periods to identify and quantify convergence/divergence patterns in key economic indicators.
- **Machine Learning Project with SVM Optimization** – Developed an SVM classifier achieving 96.7% test accuracy through hyperparameter optimization. Conducted comprehensive analysis including confusion matrix and correlation matrix to validate model performance and feature relationships. Implemented a machine learning pipeline with detailed evaluation metrics.  
## Tech Used
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotplib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Pipeline, Confusion Matrix, Hyperparameter Searching
