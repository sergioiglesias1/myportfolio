Sergio Iglesias Portfolio – Beta-Convergence Analysis

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am an Economics graduate from Cantabria with a passion for econometrics, data analysis, and visualization. I have experience in Python, MySQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, and I enjoy exploring economic trends using statistical and machine learning techniques.

The highlight of this portfolio is my Beta-Convergence Analysis, which examines economic convergence and divergence across countries using GDP per capita data from 2004 to 2024.

Project Overview

This project investigates Beta-Convergence across Emerging and Developed economies over four distinct periods:
	•	2004–2008
	•	2009–2013
	•	2014–2018
	•	2019–2024

Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn), I prepared the data, visualized growth trends, and ran regression models to determine convergence patterns. The goal is to understand whether countries with lower initial GDP per capita are catching up with wealthier nations and to analyze periods of divergence.

Features
	•	Interactive analysis: Visualizations and regression results showing convergence trends across different periods.
	•	Econometric modeling: Implementation of Beta-Convergence using linear regression in Python.
	•	Data-driven insights: Comparison of growth patterns between Developed and Emerging economies.
	•	Portfolio showcase: Highlights my technical skills and approach to real-world economic data.
