# Sergio Iglesias Portfolio - Beta-Convergence Analysis

Welcome to my personal portfolio, showcasing my journey as an Economics graduate from Cantabria. With proficiency in MySQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, and Power BI, I like econometric modeling. The centerpiece of this site is my Beta-Convergence Analysis of Country Growth between 2004 and 2024, which explores economic convergence and divergence across Emerging and Developed economies using GDP per capita data from the World Development Indicators (WDI).

## Overview
This project transforms the **Massively** template from HTML5 UP into a polished portfolio, featuring a dedicated section for my Beta-Convergence Analysis. The analysis covers four periods (2004-2008, 2009-2013, 2014-2018, 2019-2024) and leverages Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) for data processing, visualization, and regression modeling.

## Features
- A sleek, personalized portfolio with a welcome page and contact information.
- An interactive Beta-Convergence Analysis section with visualizations and insights.
- Smooth navigation enhanced by Massively’s scroll effects.
- Integration of advanced econometric techniques.

## Getting Started

### Usage
- Explore the portfolio by opening `index.html` in your web browser.
- Reproduce the analysis by running the Jupyter notebook, which includes data preparation and regression plots.

This project is built upon the **Massively** theme by HTML5 UP (html5up.net | @ajlkn), a text-heavy, article-oriented design featuring a large background image with a new parallax implementation and scroll effects powered by Scrollex. It’s a slight departure from single-page designs, fulfilling user requests and allowing experimentation with new techniques.
